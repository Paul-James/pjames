Description: A collection of functions put together for use by me.
    This is meant to help keep .Rprofile and the global environment clear. For example, the rm(list = ls()) command
    clears out any custom functions defined in the .Rprofile because those functions
    are part of the global environment. This also saves time and effort pasting/
    sourcing commonly used functions to the top of every R script you write. All
    these manual steps can be avoided with the use of a package. However, beware
    of reproducibility issues. If you need to share your code, either use base R
    functions or share the function code (IE define the functions in the top of the
    script).
