Description: A collection of functions put together for use by me.
    Everyone can add to this package as long as the functions are robust
    and have been well written and documented. This is meant to help keep .Rprofiles
    and the global environment clear. For example, the rm(list = ls()) command
    clears out any custom functions defined in the .Rprofile because those functions
    are part of the global environment. This also saves time and effort pasting/
    sourcing commonly used functions to the top of every R script you write. All
    these manual steps can be avoided with the use of a package. However, beware
    of reproducibility issues. If you need to share your code, either use base R
    functions or share the function code (EI define the functions in the top of the
    script).
